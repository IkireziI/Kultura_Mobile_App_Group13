## **Project Overview**
**Kultura** is a mobile application that provides a platform for African artists to showcase their work, connect with buyers and investors, and access educational resources. The app fosters appreciation of African art, culture, and design while also supporting job creation and skill development through its unique blend of a marketplace and learning hub.

## **Key Features**
- **Artist Portfolio Management**: Artists can create profiles, upload artwork, manage portfolios, and receive feedback from users.
- **Marketplace**: Investors and buyers can browse, save, and purchase artwork securely, as well as communicate with artists directly.
- **Educational Resources**: Provides articles, tutorials, and videos on African art and culture, along with tools to help artists enhance their skills using AI.
- **Cultural Exploration**: Showcases a diverse array of African art, including blogs and event listings that highlight global art trends and traditions.
- **Community Features**: A platform for networking, discussions, and collaborations, enabling users to connect and share knowledge.

## **Getting Started**
